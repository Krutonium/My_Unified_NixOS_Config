# Krutonium's NixOS Config

Hey, Welcome to the repo. Heres' what you need to know:

TBD

## Useful Scripts:

On a new install where you're replacing either a stock config or your own config with mine, run `link.sh`. If you've moved the repo and want it to update the repo location, run `relink.sh` instead.

For me personally I also have `set_upstream.sh` which adds my personal gitea and github as remotes that will be pushed to at the same time.

Questions? Comments? Open an Issue or contact me on Telegram [@Krutonium](t.me/Krutonium)!
